You are a poor person in an island. There is only one shop in this island, this shop is open on all days of the week except for Sunday. Consider following constraints:


	N – Maximum unit of food you can buy each day.
	S – Number of days you are required to survive.
	M – Unit of food required each day to survive.
Currently, it’s Monday, and you need to survive for the next S days. 
Find the minimum number of days (ceil value) on which you need to buy food from the shop so that you can survive the next S days, or determine that it isn’t possible to survive.

InputFormat:
The first line of the input contains three numbers S, N and M separated by space.

OutputFormat:
If it is possible to survive the print the number of days, otherwise print 'NO' without quotes.

Example-1
i/p:10,16,2

Output:2

Example-2

Input:10,20,30

Output:NO

def survival(S, N, M):
 # If we can not buy at least a week  supply of food during the first week OR We can not buy a day supply of food  on the first day then we can't survive.
    if (((N * 6) < (M * 7) and S > 6) or M > N): 
        print("NO")
    else:
         
    # If we can survive then we can buy ceil(A / N) times where A is
    # total units of food required.
        days = int((M * S) / N)
         
        if (((M * S) % N) != 0):
            days += 1
        
        print(days)

S, N, M = input().split()
S = int(S)
N = int(N)
M = int(M)
survival(S, N, M)
